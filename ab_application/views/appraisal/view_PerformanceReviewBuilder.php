                <h2>Performance Review Builder</h2>
                <p>"The Performance Review Builder takes you through a step-by-step process that results in a professionally-developed performance appraisal in minutes. Simply choose an evaluation form based on the employee's occupation (e.g., clerical, production, sales, management) or create your own by selecting from among 20 performance categories, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Job Knowledge</li>
                    <li>Quality of Work</li>
                    <li>Problem Solving</li>
                    <li>Judgment</li>
                    <li>Attendance</li>
                    <li>Communication Skills</li>
                </ul>            
                <p>Based on the ratings you assign, the Performance Review Builder generates specific comments to help you describe performance issues. It also includes the option to create a customizable action plan for improving the employee's performance.</p>
                <p>Performance reviews are such an important tool for motivating your employees and increasing their contributions to your business, but the process can be stressful. The Performance Review Builder helps you make the most of your performance reviews so your employees can achieve their true potential while at the same time contribute to the success of your business."</p>
