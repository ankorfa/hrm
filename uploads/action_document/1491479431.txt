Interview Procedure

Recap the application of progressive discipline.

If the employee requests a witness or support person, you may have to allow it. Consult with a knowledgeable employment law attorney to determine the requirements under current law, as the law in this area has shifted several times in recent years.

State the specific reasons for the discharge.

If the employee raises a question about finality, emphasize that the decision is final unless company policy and procedure provides for some appeal.

If the tenor of the interview allows it, solicit employee feedback on issues of interest to the employer.

Arrange to obtain company property in the possession of the employee.

Provide the employee his or her final paycheck if required by state law, or explain when he or she will receive the last paycheck. Also advise whether the employee will receive accrued vacation pay, and details of any other compensation or benefits that he or she will receive.

Advise the employee of COBRA or other options for continuing health coverage.

Conclude the interview as quickly as possible.
